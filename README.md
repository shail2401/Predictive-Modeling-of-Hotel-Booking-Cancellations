# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and reservation details, the model helps hotels anticipate and reduce the impact of potential cancellations.

##  Project Overview

- Developed a predictive model to classify whether a booking will be canceled.
- Explored and visualized trends in booking behavior, seasonality, and customer preferences.
- Applied feature engineering and encoding techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Used classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (classification models, model evaluation)
- Feature engineering (date extraction, one-hot encoding, target encoding)

##  Files Included

- 'Hotel_Cancellation_Prediction.ipynb' – Full notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.
- 'hotel.csv'- Dataset
- 'README.md' – Project documentation.

##  Key Insights

- Longer lead times, group bookings, and no deposit types strongly correlate with cancellations.
- Booking patterns vary significantly across hotel types and seasons.
- Feature encoding improved model performance, particularly for tree-based models.
